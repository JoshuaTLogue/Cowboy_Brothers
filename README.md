# cowboy-brothers
A two-dimensional side-scrolling platformer video game.  There will be several levels, in which the goal is to get to the flag at the end of each level.  Our character model will be a sheriff cowboy in the wild west.  At the end of the final level will be an outlaw which the player must defeat by shooting them.  If the player loses on a level, they are sent back to the level select menu, where they may choose to retry.  At the beginning of the game, only the first level will be unlocked.  Once the level is cleared, the next one unlocks and the player can go back and repeat a level they’ve already beaten.  There will be a button to reset progress to lock all levels except the first.  This design is loosely inspired by Nintendo’s Mario Brothers.
